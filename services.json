    "description": "If you have not been to the dentist in a while, I invite you to schedule your dental checkup with Smiles Dental Care. At my Mountain View dental office, I treat patients of all ages, focusing on improving the health and appearance of our patients' smiles. I understand that not everyone is excited about dental care. I also understand that due to busy schedules, a lack of insurance, or general forgetfulness, people do not visit the dentist with any regularity. If that is you, do not worry; you are not alone. According to the USA Today, 34 percent of Americans do not visit the dentist on an annual basis. While this is a large group of people, not having a dental checkup can place you at risk for a variety of health issues. We encourage you to take an hour out of your day for the benefit of your oral health and your future quality of life. To get started, all you need to do is call (650) 563-1180 and schedule an appointment. Our friendly staff will not judge you for your lack of prior dental care but will be happy to get you up to speed again.",

            "detail":"There is a direct link between visiting the dentist and keeping your natural teeth. If you want to ensure that you have a full mouth of health teeth, then visit the dentist. Gallup Poll released a study in 2014 finding that the states with the highest percentage of dental visits also had the lowest percentage of adult tooth loss. For example, in Connecticut, 74 percent of adults visited the dentist in the past year, and their rate of adult tooth loss was only 9 percent. On the other hand, only 57 percent of adults in West Virginia visited the dentist in the past year, and 37 percent of adults have complete tooth loss. The correlation is clear and should prompt you to give us a call. If you do lose your teeth, we can help by providing you with replacements in the form of dental implants, bridges, or dentures. Still, there is no need for you to experience significant tooth loss when you visit our office regularly for preventative care. Saving your teeth, after all, is less time-consuming and less expensive. Another reason to schedule a dental check-up is to make sure that you don't experience a toothache or infection. We treat patients throughout the Mountain View area and find that toothaches can create enough discomfort to cause people to miss work. In fact, according to the Center for Disease Control, 164 million work hours are lost each and every year due to dental related health issues. If you have a busy schedule and feel you do not have time for the dentist, you definitely need to schedule a dental checkup. Failing to do so could result in a more serious health condition forming and the need to take time off of work. After all, without preventative dental care, you are at a greater risk for tooth decay, infection, and gum disease."

That means that if it is created to match yellow teeth, it will remain yellow even if you have your teeth whitened at a later date. When you have the procedure done first, your new crown or bridge will be made to match your new brilliantly white teeth.When preparing for the procedure, we recommend that patients take a day off of work. If possible, you may want to take a couple of days off. It is normal for teeth to be somewhat sensitive, and it is easier if you don't have to worry about meeting clients and keeping up with your busy schedule."

            "detail":"When getting dental crowns and dental bridges installed, it is advisable that you work with a cosmetic dentist that knows how to complete the procedure in a way that looks natural. At Smiles Dental Care, we can do so while also working to keep our patients as comfortable as possible by using sedation dentistry. The process for both procedures is fairly similar. Before getting started, an impression is taken of the teeth so that the new crown or bridge can be created in a dental lab. When placing a dental crown around a tooth, Smiles Dental Care starts by preparing the tooth. We will need to remove a portion of the enamel so that there is room for the new crown to surround the tooth without pushing other teeth out of place. Once complete, we will clean the tooth and secure a temporary crown to it using removable glue. Patients typically wear a temporary crown for around two weeks while waiting for a permanent one to be created in the lab. During this time, it is important to be careful with what you eat and how you brush your teeth since the temporary is designed to come off.When the dental restoratives are complete, patients return to our Mountain View dentist office, so that we can remove the temporaries and bond the permanent ones to the tooth. For a dental crown, we will secure the cap around the tooth and complete it through dental bonding. With a bridge, a crown is placed on the two teeth that are surrounding the missing one. On top of the crown is a piece that looks like natural gums that will hold the new tooth in place. These two crowns serve as anchors for this synthetic 'bridge' and makes a new tooth as durable as it can be. Patients depend on this procedure as a way to replace missing teeth in a way that looks natural and restores the functionality of the missing tooth. "

Over the course of a couple of months, the metal post and jawbone will fuse together. This creates a level of durability that cannot be replicated in other types of procedures. Afterward, we will secure the new synthetic tooth to the metal post at the surface of the gums. The new tooth is attached so securely, that patients can eat their favorite foods, maintain an active lifestyle, play sports, and more, without fear of their tooth becoming loose or falling out. Patients can enjoy the benefits that come from never having to worry about their tooth again.The team at Smiles Dental Care provide dental implants in a way that is comfortable and functional. We take the time to make sure that every aspect of the procedure is completed correctly â€“ the first time. Teeth restored with implants will not get cavities.

After professional whitening, the toothpaste can help your teeth stay bright. Many people may try over the counter solutions like whitening trays or strips. These treatments work but not as well as professional solutions. As with most things, what you buy in the store is simply not as strong as what you can get from a medical professional. Additionally, store bought whitening trays are designed to fit everyone's teeth, not your teeth specifically. This means that they can become loose, and the solution can leak, leading to gum irritation. We recommend that people in Mountain View, schedule an appointment with William S. Hall D.D.S. instead.

            "title":"The process: How It Works",
            "detail":"When a whitening solution is applied to the teeth, the hydrogen peroxide inside of the solution penetrates through the enamel. It then starts the oxidation process where molecules are transformed to reflect less or no light. This makes them appear colorless, and teeth appear white. This process is typically extremely effective for eliminating stains and can be repeated frequently. On occasion, the stains are too strong for a teeth bleaching procedure to work. When this happens, we can provide an alternative treatment. For example, patients in Mountain View can have dental veneers placed on the surface of teeth in order to cover dark stains. This is often preferable for patients that smoke since veneers are stain resistant and won't yellow quickly like natural teeth. Still, it is wise to try a teeth whitening procedure first, before starting a cosmetic one. At Smiles Dental Care, we also recommend that patients have their teeth whitened before having other dental procedures completed. Most of the materials that are used in dental restorations or for cosmetic purposes are stain resistant and bleach resistant. For example, a dental crown won't stain or bleach but should maintain its initial coloring with time. When a crown, veneer, bridge, or implant is created in a dental lab, they are created to match the shade of the surrounding teeth. If the surrounding teeth are yellow, these restorations will be created in a yellow shade. If the surrounding teeth are a brilliant white, the restoration will be as well. This makes the timing of teeth whitening procedures important. If you live in the Mountain View area and are interested in a dental restoration, schedule your teeth whitening procedure first."

The dental pulp is removed, and oftentimes so are the roots. You only need your tooth roots to feel sensations like hot and cold and for the tooth to grow in. Once it has fully matured, removing the roots will not directly harm the tooth. It can, however, prevent the further spread of infection so when it is necessary to remove the roots; we promptly do so. Once done, we will clean the area to ensure that the infection is gone. We will typically prescribe antibiotics, as well. This ensures that any lingering infection is eliminated. In order to complete the root canal, we will seal up the hole and area where the dental pulp used to be. This is typically done with something called gutta-percha. This is a rubber-like substance that can help to stabilize the tooth now that a portion is missing. At Smiles Dental Care, we will then use a filling or crown in order to further strengthen and protect the damaged tooth. Both fillings and crowns can now be created in a tooth-color. This means that regardless of where your infected tooth is located, a crown can be used, and it will blend in seamlessly with the surrounding teeth. Patients throughout the Mountain View area appreciate how natural their tooth looks once the procedure is complete."

            "detail":"In the past, many people would need to have their teeth pulled if they became severely infected or the dental pulp became inflamed. Now, those same teeth can be saved by performing a root canal. This is a far better option because it keeps the natural tooth in place. This is important for the shape of the face because as teeth fall out the muscles in the face can start to sag. While this is not particularly common with the loss of one tooth, it is when several become infected and fall out. By treating and saving an infected tooth, we are helping to preserve our patients' facial structure. Another benefit is that once the root canal has been completed, and the filling or crown is in place; it is possible to eat like normal and without restrictions. Once the infection is gone, and the tooth is strengthened, it will behave like it used to. That makes it possible to bite down with normal force, chew, and maintain normal activities without worrying about the tooth. This helps patients throughout Mountain View get back to return to their busy schedules. A restored tooth will look completely natural if a tooth-colored crown or filling is used to restore it. In fact, crowns can be created in the exact shade of the surrounding teeth so that it blends in perfectly. This way no one will know that you ever had a procedure completed. If, in fact, you had a root canal done previously, you may want to have the filling or crown around it replaced with today's version for an improved appearance. Alternatively, if don't have a root canal endodontics procedure completed, the infected tooth will likely need to be pulled. This is essential for preventing the spread of infection. Once the tooth is removed it will need to be replaced. The options for doing so involve wearing a denture, getting a dental bridge or having dental implants installed. These are all viable solutions but take additional time, and the recovery period is longer since the procedures will take several steps. Therefore, one possible solution is for us to attempt to save your tooth by performing a root canal endodontics procedure. To learn more about this option call Smiles Dental Care at 650-563-1180 and schedule an appointment."
